# Embedded Systems

This GitHub repository contains a list of programs that I have tried out using
the STM32 microcontroller for learning about embedded systems for my coursework.

While all the code is written inside `main.c` files, you will find additional 
files and peripherals lying around because all the development has been done 
inside a Linux environment (Arch specifically). There has been no IDE usage 
and all the linking has been done through `Makefiles`.

The following is the list of things that I have learned:

0. How to setup ARM toolchain and start programming for STM32 (no IDE support)
1. GPIO Programming (Part I) - Blink LED
